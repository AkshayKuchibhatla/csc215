# C: Number Systems

## Introduction

A **number system** is a system for writing numbers using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner.

The number system that humans use has almost always been decimal, or base 10, likely because we have 10 fingers to count on. however, base 10 does not properly serve the needs of computers, and so our machines use different number systems.

## Binary

- While we humans have fingers to count on, computers have a different component: a *switch*.

- Whereas our 10 fingers can stand for 10 states, represented by the digts 0 to 9, a computer's transistor has only 2 states: ON or OFF.
- These are represented by the symbols 1 and 0.
- Therefore, computers use binary because they are, quite literally, built for it.

### Purpose of Binary

- Computers use binary to **process** and **store** information.
- Binary can be used to represent any form of data, from numbers to images and videos to audio.
- Because a computer is essentially billions upon billions of transistors, its inner workings function exclusively on numerous ONs and OFFs.

### Register Sizes

- Although all computers process information in binary, *how much* binary they can process at a time differs from machine to machine.
- This measure is called **register size**, which describes how many bits a computer's processor can handle at any given time. Register sizes come in 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits.
- For example, an 8-bit computer, such as the *Altair 8800*, can process 8 bits at a time and has registers (memory slots) that are each 8 bits wide.
