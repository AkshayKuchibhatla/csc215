# Preserving the User's Environment

This chapter discusses creating a user environment separate from that of the operating system.

- Within this user environment, we will use the 8080 registers the way we want to.
- The operating system already has a pre-programmed way of using the available registers, and we could go along with that way; however, experience has shown that it is more efficient to use our own way.
- This way will provide an interface which will allow user programs to call upon subroutines.
- These subroutines will always keep the user's registers intact, so he will never have to worry about what the system has done with them.
- The slight extra effort which will go into making this interface will pay off greatly as you write larger and larger programs in the future.

## Establishing the user's stack

- As said in the previous chapter, the stack is a handy place to hold data in programs.
- The stack grows downward in memory from the initial address contained in the stack pointer (SP).
- So, we must allocate some space in memory for the use of the stack, and set the SP to point to the top of that space.

### Saving space in RAM

- User programs execute within the transient program area (TPA), which is part of RAM.
- So, we can save a block in this memory for the use of the stack, and set the SP to the top of that area.
- A resonable starting size for the stack is 64 bytes. This way, the stack could fit 32 successful PUSHes of register contents; or, it could nest 32 levels of subroutine CALLs.
- This would make the stack more than enough for most programs.
- To set up the space in RAM, we will include the following code **at the bottom of each of our programs**:

```asm
        DS  64  ;STACK AREA
STAK:   DB  0   ;TOP OF STACK
```

>**Note:** Semicolons designate single-lined comments in assembly language.

- "DS" stands for **D**efine **S**torage, and it allocates a block of memory equal in size to the number specified.
- "DB" stands for **D**efine **B**yte, and it will set up a single-byte memory location with initial contents as specifed by the operand.
- Both DB and DS are pseudo-operations, in that they specify details to the assembler about the execution of the program but do not produce any object code that can be executed.
- DS defines the size of the stack, while DB defines the starting point of it and labels that starting point in memory as "`STAK`."

### Stack pointer

- Next, we have to define the stack pointer so that we know where we are in memory.
- We can do this by including the following line at the beginning of our code:

```asm
START: LXI    SP,STAK   ;SET UP STACK POINTER
```

- The line of code above loads the stack pointer with the starting address of the block allocated in RAM for stack.
- This way, as the stack grows downward in memory, the stack pointer will also move down.

### The CCP

- However, this brings up an interesting question: why did we not take the time to allocate stack space in the sample program from the introduction?
- Here is the program:

![Sample program from introduction](../ch_7/ch_7_image3.png)

- In this program, when the CALL BDOS line is exectuted, the computer must save the address of the next instruction by pushing the program counter (PC) to the stack; otherwise, it would not be able to continue execution of the program once the BDOS subroutine finished executing.
- However, no stack space was defined in this program using the lines of code mentioned above; so, how did the program program still work?
- Whenever a command is issued to the Console Command Processor (CCP), such as "TEST," for example, from the CON:, the CCP loads the contents of the .COM file into the TPA and start executing.
- To execute, each program needs some stack space and a stack pointer so that it can make function calls, push register contents, et cetera.
- In the case of TEST, the system executes the command **using a stack space and pointer that have been initialized by CP/M**.
- Thus, when the TEST.COM file finishes loading in, the SP is pointing to usable stack space withing the CCP.
- This stack space is very limited because it is being used by the command as well as by the CCP. Therefore, it can only fit very small programs.
- Hence, it is more practical to assign stack space independently for each subroutine to use, so that overflow errors and system crashes can be avoided.

## Saving the user's register contents

- In order to maintain the separation between the user and the system, we write all of our subroutines in such a way that they preserve the contents of the registers, other than SP and A.
- We can do this by pushing the contents of the B, C, D, E, H, and L registers onto the stack at the start of every I/O subroutine:

```asm
CO:    PUSH    B    ; SAVE REGISTERS
       PUSH    D
       PUSH    H
        •      •
        •      •
```

- Now, no matter what a subroutine does with the registers, we can always get back their contents by POPing them off the stack:

```asm
        •      •    ; RESTORE REGISTERS
        •      •
       POP     H
       POP     D
       POP     B
       RET
```

> Notice how registers are POPped off the stack in the reverse order that they are PUSHed on. This is because the stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) mechanism, so the last in (H) must be the first out.

- Because all of the I/O subroutines will maintain this practice of PUSHing and POPping, our programs will constantly have full access to all of the working registers.

## Calling BDOS

- Suppose that our program calls the console output (CO:) logical device to print a character **stored in register A** to the console.
- Experience has showed us that BDOS wants that character to be in register E and for a function code to be in register C when it is called.
- So, after pushing all of the registers to the stack, we just need to execute the following lines of code before calling the the CO: subroutine:

```asm
        •      •
        •      •
       MVI     C, WCONF   ; SELECT FUNCTION
       MOV     E, A       ; MOV CHAR FROM A TO E
       CALL    BDOS
        •      •
        •      •
        
```

- The first line in the code above loads the write to console function into register C.
- The second line moves the character stored in register A to register E.
- Finally, the third line calls the BDOS subroutine.
- This serves as an example of how we would set up one of our subroutines to run properly be moving things around in memory.

## Returning to CP/M

- After a subroutine finishes execution, we always want to return to the operating system safely.
- The safest way to do this is to use the JMP 0 instruction, which will place the program counter at the beginning of CP/M's instructions.
- This will stop the program and reload CP/M in an orderly way, so that the user will not have to hit the RESET switch to end every program.
