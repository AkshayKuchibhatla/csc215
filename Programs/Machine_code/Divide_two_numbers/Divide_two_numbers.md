# How to Divide Two Numbers on the *ALTAIR 8800*

This program will take two numbers from memory, divide one by the other, then store the result in memory.

## Part 1: How Division Works

Just as multiplication is repeated addition at its core, division is repeated subtraction. The quotient of a dividend and divisor is the number of times that the divisor can consecutively be subtracted from the dividend without the result being a negative number.

For example, let's solve **72 รท 8** using repeated subtraction:

| # Subtraction | Subtraction | Difference |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | 72 - 8 | 64 |
| 2   | 64 - 8 | 56 |
| 3   | 56 - 8 | 48 |
| 4   | 48 - 8 | 40 |
| 5   | 40 - 8 | 32 |
| 6   | 32 - 8 | 24 |
| 7   | 24 - 8 | 16 |
| 8   | 16 - 8 | 8  |
| 9   | 8 - 8  | 0 |

The reason that 72 รท 8 = 9 is because 8 can be subtracted from 72 nine consecutive times without the difference being negative. This is the essence of division.

## Part 2: Programming Division onto the *ALTAIR*

There are 4 steps to this program:

1. Store the divisor in one register and store the dividend in another register. Additionally, reserve one register for the quotient of the division.
2. Check if the dividend is greated than the divisor.
3. If it is, subtract the divisor from the dividend, increment the quotient register by 1 and repeat step 2. If it is not, move on to step 4.
4. Store the quotient and the remainder, which is what would be left of the dividend after the divisor has been subtracted from the from it enough times, in memory.

|`CMP`|Compares the dividend in the accumulator with the divisor in register `B`.|10 111 000|B8|
|`JNC`|If the dividend is less than the divisor and division is no longer possible, the previous instruction would have made the carry bit would have been set to `0`. Therefore, there would be no carry and the program would have to jump to the `STA` instruction to end the program.|11 011 010|DA|
|(Address byte 1)|The **less significant** byte of the address which the program counter will jump to.|00 010 000|10|

|`SUB`|Subtract the divisor in register `B` from the dividend in the accumulator.|10 010 000|90|
|`INR`|Increment the C register, which is the quotient register, after a subtraction.|00 001 100|0C|

|(Address byte 1)|The **less significant** byte of the address of the `CMP` instruction in memory.|00 000 111|07|
|(Address byte 2)|The **more significant** byte of the address of the `CMP` instruction in memory.|00 000 000|00|
